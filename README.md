# Project-Direct-Digital-Synthesizer-
This project implements a Direct Digital Synthesizer (DDS) on the Digilent Nexys A7 FPGA board using Verilog HDL. The system generates a sine wave by incrementing a phase accumulator and using its output to address a sine lookup table (LUT). A 10-bit digital output is sent through PMOD GPIO pins to an external R-2R ladder DAC, which converts the signal into an analog waveform. The output frequency can be precisely controlled by adjusting the phase increment value. The resulting analog signal can be observed using a Digital Storage Oscilloscope (DSO).
